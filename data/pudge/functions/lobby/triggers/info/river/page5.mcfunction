During a deathmatch, a red screen tint appears and the normal background music is interrupted. All players slowly lose health over time, the speed of which will increase the longer the deathmatch goes on. Players cannot respawn during a deathmatch; they instead spectate the remaining players until the deathmatch ends. Once one entire team has been defeated, the deathmatch concludes and the remaining alive players evenly split a 100 gold bounty. The game then resumes as normal."}]
